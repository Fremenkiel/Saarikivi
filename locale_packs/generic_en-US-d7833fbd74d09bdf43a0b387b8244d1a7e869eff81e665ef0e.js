Other than the obvious, what makes them different? The first is from the old world and the latter from the new world. The distinction between the two worlds is mainly a matter of geography, but it's also used to explain differences in winemaking styles and practices. Remember how the ancient Greeks were some of \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece_and_wine\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe first to make wine\u003c/a\u003e? Not surprisingly, the Greeks are part of the old world, which basically covers Europe. The new world is everything else.\nThe distinction between new world and old world wines often ignite discussions about modern vs. traditional wine making, because many wine lovers believe the differences are obvious: Old world wines are more earthy, terroir based in the style. New world wines are more fruity, exotic and squeaky clean. Whatever side of the fence you belong to, it might leave you with something to chew the next time you're sipping on wine.\nTake for instance \u003ca href=\"https://www.vivino.com/grapes/viognier\"\u003ethe Viognier grape\u003c/a\u003e Grown in both France and The United States, it makes wines that differ in flavor, aroma and alcohol. Curious? Check out reviews from Vivino users around the world and maybe you'll notice the difference.","header":"Countries","meta":{"description":"Wine countries are more than just its different geography but

It's the winemaker's personal playing field (well, vineyard). It's a place of production, storage, tastings and also a holiday destination for many wine lovers.\nWineries are often on hillside and on soil of marginal value to other plants. A common saying is that \"the worse the soil, the better the wine\". Planting on hillsides, especially those facing north (in the southern hemisphere) or south (in the northern hemisphere), is often in an attempt to maximize the amout of sunlight that falls on the winery.\nWineries vary in size and production style. Some are family businesses passed down from many generations and still stick to the winemaking styles of their great, great grandfathers. Other wineries have fewer years in the bag and belong to the modern family of winemaking. Another way to distinguish between wineries is not by looking at how the wine is made, but looking at where. Take for instance a farm winery. Here the wine is often produced and sold straight from the winery, whereas a commercial winery doesn't necessarily need to have the vineyard and place of production located adjacently\nThe rules and laws are many and different to country and region, but with more than 100,000 wineries in the Vivino database there are plenty of wines to explore.
